## ü§î Description

This project provide a markdown to markdown converter that adds a [Bi-Directional Link](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals)
Section at the end of each markdown files that is converted.


The project also provide a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) so you can easily integrate it within your own projects easily

It relies heavily on the [Marko](https://github.com/frostming/marko/tree/master/marko) python package that is the only 
Markdown Parser with a Markdown Renderer that I know of.

## üí≠ Why

I believe a great amount of information can be extracted from collaborative notes if we take time to structure them correctly.

I wanted:
- To make collaborative notes
- To organize the notes in a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) like manner
- Everyone to be able to navigate through the notes without installing anything
- This system to be easily adopted by a software engineering team.

Using git and this converter as a pre-commit, I can easily do all of this ! üöÄ

## üèÉ Getting Started
<details>
  <summary>Installation as a python package with pip</summary>

Considering you already have python available. You can simply add th

```bash

or install with `Poetry`

Then you can see all the option of the CLI using

```bash
marko-backlinks --help

<details>
  <summary>Installation as a pre-commit hook</summary>
This pre-commit hook use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool that you will
need to install.

Add the following line to your pre-commit configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) at the root of your 
repository.
